F09E5.15,WBGene00006434,Stress response,Stress response: oxidative,Stress response: oxidative,"prdx-2 encodes one of two C. elegans typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, peroxidase enzymes that reduce hydrogen peroxide and contribute to the oxidative-stress response of multicellular organisms; loss of  prdx-2 activity results in increased sensitivity to sublethal doses of hydrogen peroxide and increased resistance to heavy metals,  likely via increased expression of Phase II detoxification enzymes  such as GCS-1 in a SKN-1-independent manner; in addition, loss of prdx-2 results in decreased longevity and conditions that elevate  levels of hyperoxidized PRDX-2 result in increased thermotolerance; PRDX-2 is expressed from early embryogenesis through postembryonic development, where it is detected in the intestine, gonad, and neurons; PRDX-2 appears to be a cytoplasmic protein, excluded from the nucleus; intestinal expression of PRDX-2 is necessary and sufficient for survival in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, but cannot rescue the heavy-metal resistance and longevity phenotypes of prdx-2 mutants."
